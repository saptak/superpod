  "full_text": "So, historically that was the case. But in the last 10-15 years, the number of people taking up this examination from Karnataka is also high. So, the number of people getting qualified… Oh, you mean the Karnataka representation in the UPSC. Now it has increased. Now it has improved. Now it has tremendously improved. If I can say in Karnataka, what is our problem, at least according to a few of these people, there are very few people in our centre, and there are more in other states. Sir, as I was saying, there are very few people going out of Karnataka. People who come from other states also go to Karnataka. Because the system here is very good. The environment is good. And there are no other problems. And the IPS cadre is very smooth. It is going on well. The path to politics through police. Like, I think Anushit will make a great politician. Is there a path? Is that something you would consider? I think many people who tried this path failed. Few succeeded. None of the IPS officers or All India Service officers who have joined politics after retirement have been successful. Very few. Why is that? Because your perception of the society is different compared to a politician. He struggles hard. He builds this thing. He comes from the grassroots. He goes and shouts slogans on the road. Goes with the people. He has to live with the people. Understand their problems. Go to the police station. Go to the officer's office. Solve their problems. And then shout at officers and all those things. They have to live with the people. People are their oxygen. Unlike us, we are more used to the positional authority, positional comforts and all those things. Now, post retirement, you can't mix with the people the way the politician mixes with them and understands them. So, always there is a gap. Because of that gap, very few have been successful. Unlike those who have left the department early. There have been some sub-inspectors who have left the department early and then they have joined politics. They have become successful. Second time, third time they have become MLAs. Some have become ministers also in the past. But not those who have completed their term in the police department and then left the department. Also, I think you need to work hard at it. And you have the energy and the drive when you are, say, 30, 40. You have to get into the earlier era of politics. Now, you cannot parachute and become a success in politics and become an MLA or a minister. End of the day, a politician is a mass leader, right? For that constituency energy. You have to nurture the constituency. You have to work with the people. Be with them. You have to work hard at it. What skill set makes a good policeman? Inherent talent. Common sense. Common sense. That is for every role, sir. Even in my job. It's very uncommon. In the police department. Very uncommon. There is a good saying, right? Common sense is a common thing, commonly lacking in people. But outside of common sense, how good is, how important is being a good auditor? Like somebody like you has to probably command a big team of policemen. Communication skills are important. So, you have to make speeches often. Not lengthy speeches, but then yes, your communication skills have to be good. Especially with the public and with your juniors, with your subordinates. Because police is one job where you work with the people. Unlike other departments, again, like finance or even other departments also. Here, you have to work with the people. Without people, you cannot function at all. So, your communication skills have to be good. And your ability to convince. He might be agitated. He might be angry with you. Convince or confuse, like they jokingly say. Who are you talking about? The criminal or the… No, no. Somebody who is complaining. Even a person who says he is agitating for some… He is protesting for some… You have to be in a position to convince them. And say that, okay, these are things which we… See, for him, his problem is important. He may not be understanding the legal aspect of it. But legally, it may not make a case for us to, you know, say it could be a civil dispute. A dispute between brother and two brothers. So, he comes to us for redressal of his grievance. Now, to convince him that this is not a police issue, you have to go to a civil court and other things. You need some communication skills and convincing ability to talk to him and all. One friend of mine in police, again, was saying, the budget for a police station to run, that is provided to the station, is so low, that the police almost does not have a choice but to take bribes in order to make the police station run. That's again a myth. Yeah. Maybe the case may be 15-20 years back. Not anymore. I think everything is well budgeted for. And you have sufficient budget to take care. It's just that how you plan it. If you plan for something and you budget for it, you do get the required funds. Like, for example, what you just saw. We have been able to do that only through government funding. Not through anybody else. Yeah? Yeah, absolutely. It's just that you need to make a case out for it. And anyway, the day-to-day running of the thing is done, implemented, executed properly. Right. So that it's put to good use. You should try this. Podi toast. It's like that idli podi thing. Yeah, sure. With bread. With bread. Oh, chutney and the bread. Yeah. It's like chutney and bread. Anujit, I'm going to ask you a very tough question to answer. Yeah. I'm from Bangalore, as Bangalorean as anybody can be. Right. Wherever I go and tell good things about Bangalore, people tell me traffic, traffic, traffic. Right. What is the problem? What is the solution? Is there a solution? Yeah, of course. I also think that the problem is overstated. Because, I don't know, bad PR. Maybe we have not done a good job of saying the story. Maybe this is your chance to reduce that. Yeah, so I think the amount of criticism we get is totally disproportionate to the problem at hand. I think every major metropolitan city across the world faces the issue of traffic. Because, let's face it, cities are magnets or attractive places for employment. It attracts a lot of people. And year on year, a city grows. The thing with Bangalore has been that post 2000, after the IT boom, there has been a significant explosive growth. And the infrastructure has not commensurately grown with the growth of vehicles or the human population. Now, Bangalore has the highest number of vehicles per thousand. It's 872 per thousand population. Is it more than Bombay and Delhi? More. Yeah? Simply incomparable. Hyderabad is comparable. It's at about 750. But Bangalore is very high. We have 1.5 crore population with 1.23 crore vehicle population. Right? So, with the kind of explosive growth. So, the compounded annual growth rate of vehicles is 8%. Right? We doubled in between 2013 and 2023. It was 56 lakhs. It became 1.12 crores. Right? So, if you see that kind of growth rate, infrastructure will never be enough. So, with that in mind, the government had planned for various public transportation systems to come up. Historically, Bangalore has this problem of lack of public transport facilities. The only public transport facilities before the metro came in was the BMTC buses. Unlike other cities like Kolkata, you had the trams. In Delhi, you had the metro. In Mumbai, you had the Mumbai local. Right? Which is not the case here. Can I tell you a story in between? Yeah. Near my house on Banargata Road, metro construction started, I don't know, 10 years ago. It's still going on. So, at some level, like you're saying, public infra has not kept up and maybe it can't. Is it somebody's fault that it hasn't kept up? No, I don't think so. I think, end of the day, the intention is what matters. Right? See, had there been no thinking of will we improve public transport at all, I think it would have been a worse off situation. Just to give you an example, when the Byapnalli line got connected to the Wildfield line, automatically, peak hour traffic reduced by 17%. Automatically. That just shows how, just interlinking to this thing, or how important public transport is. So, now, a lot of impetus is given. So, the long-term solution to Bangalore's problems are public transport, whether it's K-Ride, suburban trains, or it is the metro, increasing the fleet, whatever it is, I think that's the way to go forward. And that's where it is. It is just that the implementation has taken some time. But when it comes in, you will definitely see a change. Like for example, when the Outering Road line opens for metro, not only will the metro be available,",
