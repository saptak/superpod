  "full_text": "the carriage space where the metro work is going on, which has reduced because of the metro work, would not be there. I mean, you'd get the full entire 10 lane available to you. I think it would improve. I think that's the way to go. And in the short term measures like implementation of AI based signals, technology implementation of or leveraging technology, some short term works, civil works, also like junction tree design, some bit of traffic engineering, which is being done on a day to day basis. Like when we go to the West in different countries or China and all that, there are many places where we go, there's no potholes only. And then when you come back home, and you see so many potholes, they have the same density of population, if not more in many cases. One has to wonder, why is it better there than here? And what can change? See, outside of young people seriously considering wanting to be a policeman on this, which is what I hope we can accomplish. Even if we can suggest two or three things to the government, you know more than most people know about roads and traffic and all of that. What can be changed? See, I think one is the road usage itself. If you go to a good city, like even Delhi, I mean, let's not compare other cities with Delhi. Heavy goods vehicles don't enter Delhi at all. There are terminals, where they come and they exit from there, they don't enter the city. So, a highway is built according to those standards. You cannot have a highway standards inside a city for collector roads or sub collector roads. There are certain standards which have to be maintained. So, if Bangalore had a peripheral network, we could just bypass the heavy goods vehicles, right? All transportation goods. They wouldn't ply on our outer ring road or inside the city. And is that what is damaging the road the most? No, no, no. I'm saying the standard of road required for such a heavy vehicle to ply on, on a regular basis, cannot be maintained inside a city. So, that's one example of what are the factors. One of the factors for congestion, it can be for road maintenance. The second thing is our drainage systems, right? Our drainage systems need to be improved. It is being done now. Waterlogging becomes a major problem, a major hurdle for traffic management, especially during rainy season. So, that needs to be improved. So, you're saying there are so many of these issues that you guys don't have control over, but you take the blame off? Yeah, traffic, that is the problem. Traffic management, traffic police has a very minimal role in that. Otherwise, most of the things fall in the realm of other departments. They have to work with. That's why coordination becomes a major task of head of traffic police, whoever is there, with BBNP, with BDA, with NHAI. So, so many other agencies you have to work with. BWSSB, BESCOM, because somebody digs the road, then somebody again digs it. So, these kind of problems keep occurring. Is there any other common sense kind of thing that you think should be implemented by the government, but is not being implemented? Not just in traffic, it could be in crime, any other department. What can the government change, which will make policing better? In traffic management, yes, traffic management is the public transport, which needs to be given more focus, more stress. It should happen faster also, right? I don't know. Could the metro not have been built faster? I'm not blaming one government or the other, because I think every government has passed by. But shouldn't the metro have been completed faster than the amount of time it has taken or is taking? The challenges they face were also like that. The rock format, like for example, that underground rock near Majestica, Vidhan Soudhana, the cutting machine, they never expected that kind of a problem to occur. So, those kind of things does come up. But then one common sense they think is that flyovers do not solve polio traffic problems. Yeah, just shifts congestion from one point to the next. Then why do people keep building flyovers? Even now it's being built. That's one of the common sense they think, which is missing, probably. So instead of flyover, focus that money and time on? Public transport. Like metro? Metro, BMTC, increase the strength of BMTC buses and… I don't know if this number is right. Like when me and Anujet was speaking earlier about that air taxi thing, somebody was telling me to build a kilometre of metro line, it cost something like 150 crores. Long term… Can I have a regular coffee? Cappuccino? Cappuccino? Cappuccino? Yeah. Do you like sugar in it? Yeah, yeah, with some sugar. You can… You can take this off. You can try the avocado toast also. Yeah, I'll try this. The food is nice. Looks good. So I'll tell you, the agenda for places like this, right, I have a fund. So we pick niche Indian brands. Like Indian, when I say clothing, there's a brand called 1111. So we are trying to create an ecosystem of all these Indian first brands and say, don't buy LV Gucci, buy Indian. Yeah. In every capacity. We don't have exposure in the auto space, but we still tell that they're also that, you know, buy Indian cars, buy Indian clothes. But is it happening or difficult? It's happening to some extent. Because this Gucci and all that become fashion statements. They had, I think, five, ten years ago, but off late, I don't know. There seems to be a big shift from LV Gucci to, I think, Gucci. LV Gucci to, I think, streetwear brands in India. People are using rebellion as a emotion that they're resonating with a lot. What do you think of movies where hero is beating up police and making police look bad? I think in large part, why people are scared of police people is also Bollywood movies. Every hero is like, you know, at the end of the movie, the hero is either beating up the corrupt policemen or something on those. No, but movies don't reflect the reality, especially the Indian movies. They don't reflect the reality. They might not reflect the reality, but they have a big part to play in the psychology of the masses. Absolutely. No, but there are movies which have lionized police as well, right? Singham. No, either that extreme or this extreme. But reality is somewhere in between. Reality is absolutely missing. I think the only film which came close was Arath Satya. Govind Niyalani, 40 years back. Which other Hindi movie or Kannada movie has really come close to depicting police reality? Maybe Sarfarosh to some extent. Yeah, that was a great movie. There was a Kannada movie called Smiling Buddha. Have you seen KGF? KGF? He destroys a police station in that. But people like that. If you watch that movie, when Yash goes to the police station with that automatic thing. Yeah. And shoots the whole thing. First thing, no policeman dies in that scene. I was just trying to remember that scene. And then when he walks into the police station, most people, the policemen are like, Oh, Rocky bhai, I'm so scared of you. They depict that emotion. But the public loves that. Why does the public love a gangster who policemen are scared of? This has been the theme for a long time in many, many movies. It has been stereotyped like that over the years. And that popular perception has remained. Like I was watching Pushpa of late. Like even there he goes to police station, hires all the police people. Like why do people like this? Is it they are scared of something? What they are scared of is scared of another thing. And that is appealing to them? They find resonance in that? I don't know. We have never psychoanalyzed these things. But I think it's an entertainment factor. I think we should leave it at that. I think there's no point. See, the thing is, to be very honest, they don't at least depict reality as it is. You can't expect it to depict the reality. If you want to do it, then it's not entertaining. Otherwise it is no longer a movie. It becomes a documentary. So I think whatever works as an entertainment value, people do so. People will do it. We should see it for what it is, a movie. And enjoy it if possible. Yesterday I was training with my gym trainer.",
