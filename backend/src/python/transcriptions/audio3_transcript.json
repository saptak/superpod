  "full_text": "So, basically, what we have done, we have repurposed a few of the CCTV cameras of the Safe City project. Right. Taken the feeds. Right. And managed traffic as well as with that. So, this is, basically, we have repurposed about 1,500 cameras. Right. So, we basically monitor important corridors in Bangalore. This is the physical monitoring happening. This is a platform called Astram that we're using. It's basically actionable intelligence for sustainable traffic management. It collates data from multiple sources. Right. Like our CCTV feeds from mobility operators, map services, and our staff on the ground. So, anything which affects traffic, like a vehicle off-road accident, tree fall, water logging, procession, rally, anything, it's uploaded here. Right. We take some insights as to what could be the traffic in the next 30-60 minutes, where it's going to affect, and then take remedial measures. One thing it does do is, it automatically transmits this data to map services, to mobility aggregators. For example, if you have been using Google or Apple recently, you'll be finding that an accident is here. Especially in Bangalore. Right. All that is generated here. And pushed back. So, it tells their algorithm as well, and secondly, it helps any user also to make an informed decision, whether he would like to take that route or this thing. And it also, we can give a certainty of time, from point A to point B. How much more time is this thing? Rather than what is estimated. Yeah. So, this, we are able to monitor accidents, we are able to monitor violations, we are able to monitor the corridor speeds, corridor congestion length, and other things. Congestion length, so we basically monitor 21 corridors in Bangalore, totaling a length of about 3,500 kilometers. This is like the day-by-day distribution of congestion length. So basically, this helps us monitor what is the congestion across a period of 24 hours, what it was compared to the last Sunday, what it is compared to yesterday, and for a particular time. So, this is basically a big data platform. Right. Using a bit of AI. Right. And now we are building, using this data to feed into our digital twin, which is being developed. Right. I'll just show you a rudimentary form of it later. Right. That is the AI-based signals that we are using. Basically, this uses AI at the junction. It uses computer vision, understands what is the traffic load in each arm of the junction. Right. What has a higher traffic load, that is given a preference. Right. And there is a basic minimum and maximum cycle time. Right. So, this helps us optimize the signal timing at each junction. Right. So, if there is no vehicle at the junction, ideally no timing should be given for that junction. Right. Right. So, we give that. This is implemented in 165 junctions of Bangalore city. We have seen a tremendous reduction in the waiting time, maybe 17 to 22 percent, which is perceptible. Secondly, from an operational point of view, the amount of men deployed for each junction has reduced. Right. And our manual signalling has come down from about 40 percent to 5 percent now. So, right now we can see, this is RV Road Teachers College. Right. So, from Lalbah Westgate is on right now. Right. And from Fourth Main Jain Nagar, it's on. The human form is for pedestrian signal timing, and you can see how much time has been allocated there. So, this is live. And if you want to do priority signalling here, we can do priority signalling across corridors. So, these traffic signals, are they based on a preset time or is it based on the amount of cars waiting at that time? These junctions on the amount of cars waiting at that time. And you measure the number of cars by GPS? Through computer vision. Cameras. Cameras. Both at the junction. Cameras, basically. And at the mid-block of the junction, to understand what's the queue length. So, the algorithm works there to understand how much time should be given for each junction. So, the time allocated… And it also works on historical data also, right? Yes. It has the historical data also. Last three months' data also it takes. And you can change the time live. It's a dynamic thing. It's extremely dynamic. Right. The system learns on its own. So, actual machine learning is happening. Right. Right. And the one on the right, we have basically, bottom screen is the drones that we are using. We are having 10 drones. So, during peak hours, we fly these drones to understand how is the traffic movement across important corridors. Like, the elevated corridor to the airport is an important corridor for us. Right. So, that helps us, gives us a line-of-sight kind of perception into how is the traffic flowing. Right. You can understand the grid, basically. Because many a times, congestion is somewhere. Right. The reason is somewhere, but congestion is elsewhere. Right. So, here we can make out what is the reason. Maybe vehicle breakdown is there, BMTC bus has broken down. Right. So, we can understand that and accordingly, we can decide further course of action. Right. Very interesting. And the people working down are? Our staff. Right. There are some staff from the vendors as well. Right. At the signaling and all that. Right. And we have the control room below this. Right. We use digital communication. That's the fastest and best way of communicating. Because it's a broadcast system. Right. If I want to broadcast that a vehicle is moving, let's say an ambulance is going from one hospital to the other. Ambulance priority, they do very well. If an ambulance is going, if they inform us which hospital and all, they clear it. We have this thing called ePath as well. So, any ambulance who wishes priority can just say start and destination and seek. Just press okay. So, we get to know and we track it here and we give clearance. Every day about 20 to 22 ambulances. You are asking what will happen if you break the, this thing, no? So, that's where you will know. So, that's how the camera captures the violation and sends the chalan. Tell me this, all these politicians are always breaking the signals. Do they get chalan? Yeah, they do. Yeah? They do. They keep paying? They have to because the driver has to. Because it goes wrong. Everybody pays. Yeah. And the policy here is that nothing will be changed unless there is a wrongly raised chalan, which is extremely rare now. Right. So, this is the smart enforcement center. So, here we have basically two tools. The primary tool is this ITMS system. This ITMS basically stands for Intelligent Traffic Enforcement Management System. These are basically AI-based cameras, which are at important junctions, which detect seven types of violations. Right. And like not wearing a seat belt, not wearing a helmet, and the violation is automatically raised. We have human validators here who are validating the accuracy of that chalan that is raised. Randomly? No, each and every one we check. Yeah. It helps with machine learning, right? How many chalans are generated per day? About 30,000 violations are generated, about 20,000 are chalaned. Right. Photo evidence, this thing works. Right. So, we take four kinds of photos and one is of the number plate as well. And what happens is because of this, we are able to annotate and give it back to the system as well to do the learning. Right. Like when we started off, if you're wearing a black shirt and the seat belt was black in color, it would not detect. Right. But today it detects. Ah. Right. So, and even if we have an error rate of 3%, if you're generating 30,000 violations, that's about 900 to 1,000 a day. So, if you generate 1,000 wrong chalans, you have 3.65 lakh people in one year who have got wrong chalans. Every road is being monitored, you think? For chalans? Not all roads. Not all roads. In the phase two, yeah. We'll have almost all roads, we'll have 50 now, plus 25, 75, plus 250, 325 junctions which are monitored, which would cover the entire Bangalore, all the main junctions of Bangalore will cover. We have traffic signal lights in 500 junctions, so 325 junctions would be covered with these cameras. Is it expensive, like this putting up the camera and then monitoring it? Yeah. So, in the first phase, we put up actual hardware and the software to analyze it. But in the second phase, we have repurposed the safe city cameras. So, we just put the AI engine here. Right. So, you can see it there in the next room. But, basically, you can chalan more number of vehicles, number one. Second thing is that issue of policemen stopping the vehicles and issuing the chalan. The physical interface is gone, human interface. And you have a violation photo, right? You have a proof of evidence. So, nearly 97% of our chalaning is contactless. Contactless. Only 3%, that is drunk driving, then signal jump and a few other specific drives they do. Only that one, they do physical enforcement. Rest all is contactless. And the quality of photograph is also good. So, that's why jokingly I say, it doesn't even just capture the driver wearing seatbelt, even the co-passenger sitting in the front also. So, you should be careful with whom you are traveling. Otherwise, if the photo goes home, someone will…",
