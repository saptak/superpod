  "full_text": "the 24 by 7 media, social media and even the RTI and this kind of things. This is what I was talking about, when they break the signal, will you find them, politicians? No, this won't be. This is a convoy going, generally they give the green signal there. They don't break this thing, but generally they get green and they are going. Generally when a VVIP convoy is moving, that is the chief minister or the governor, we ensure that the corridor is kept free for their movement. There is a philosopher who used to say, just because of position in society, either by virtue of capitalism or rank in the government, you can't wash away the responsibility you have as a trustee of another's time. It's true. Do you think it's right for VIPs to break lines or break traffic rules in a manner, inconvenience the public, so that they can get from point A to B faster? I would rephrase the question as whether they should enjoy this preferential movement. For a person holding the position of chief minister or even the governor or the prime minister, it becomes all the more necessity and not a matter of show off kind of a thing. It becomes a matter of necessity, he has to move, plus security concerns also matter. Most of these individuals have high security threat perception also. From that perspective also, it has to be ensured that they get free movement, otherwise, end route something can happen. And I think the incumbent government and the prime minister has done a good job of reducing how many of these people have that privilege, but do you still feel like there are too many people with that privilege? No, it's on the constitutional posts. So basically the security arrangements or schemes are done as per the position occupied by that individual. So depending on that, even in Bangalore, it's not that everybody gets that preferential treatment. It's just that there are that many number of positions in our government, which require that kind of a security scheme, which requires priority signalling or preferential signalling. But you would prefer that lesser people have it? Yeah. The lesser the better. Because it's less inconvenient. And now because of these adaptive signals and all that what Chet was explaining, now the human intervention is less there. Earlier, all these signals used to be having manual control, the traffic man there, whenever he sees any red light vehicle going, he can turn the signal to green and all that. But now that has been reduced. So most of the times they are running on VAC, that's vehicle actuated control. Only when an ambulance is going or some this type of a convoy is moving, at that time we turn it to the manual mode. Majority of the time. What is the percentage? It's 5% sir. So 5% of the time it's on manual? Manual. Otherwise, 95% of the time it's on, yeah in 24 hours, it's vehicle actuated. So if, I'll ask this to both of you, if I am 20 years old and considering what my profession should be when I grow up, can you talk about the life of a policeman, not just from the theory lens, but maybe the family lens, your position in society, the financial lens. What are the reasons why I should be a policeman first? Why is it a good choice for me? Being a policeman, number one, pride in wearing the uniform, that is generally many people prefer that one. And second thing, in terms of financial, it is reasonably good compared to the government, other government jobs also. As Anusheth has explained, at the constable level, at the sub-instructor level, and then we have the DSP level, then the IPS also is there. At constable level, now it is becoming very, very competitive mainly because none of the government departments are hiring, it's only the police and education and health, these are the sectors which are hiring, most of the other departments are going for outsourced model. I am assuming most of the people watching this would be thinking, can I clear UPSC and join? Is that, are the odds of clearing UPSC so low, I know Anusheth cleared in the second term. It's very tough, now it has become very complicated and extremely, extremely competitive. I think about 10 lakh people write it every year. Now about 10 lakh people apply, about 5-6 lakh people write, out of which about 10-14 thousand get qualified for the main examination, from that it filters down to 3000 for the interview and hardly about 850-2000 get selected. So IPS would be about 150 out of that. But is it worth the effort then, like if I have at 20 to dedicate 2-3 years to study and then take the exam and all of that. See it depends on what you are looking at from the job perspective, nowadays people have a lot of options, especially in the private sector and other things. But then the police job or the IPS job or the UPSC job, number one it gives job security and other things are definitely there. What is the psychological element that made you want to take the UPSC, even if you wanted to be IAS first, but then picked IPS, why did you spend so much time? I picked IPS mainly because I got the home state of it. So being in home state has its own advantage, that's number one. Second thing is the status, the prestige attached to the post. Is it power? It is definitely, power is there, social status is there, but more importantly, if you think from the police perspective, police department is the only department where you can provide instant justice to the people. In all other departments you will either be pushing files or even you move some proposal by the time it gets materialized, it takes a lot of time, long time, the gestation period is very long, but here you can provide instant justice to the people who come to you for some help and assistance or something like that, something wrong has happened, he comes to you and then you solve their problem. Not even from the lens of what you can do after becoming a policeman, but just wanting to be a policeman, power I can see evidently. Financially I am assuming the amount of effort required to clear UPSC, if you put in an equal and equivalent effort in other things, you would probably end up making more money in those careers, I can argue. So what else is there? What is the... Job security, mainly. Otherwise in other jobs, especially in the private sector, you have the risk, right? Iron fire policies. That job security, sir, was a big thing 20 years ago when there was a lack of jobs. In today's world where all these young people are doing 3-4 jobs at one time, they like the transient nature of being able to move. I don't know how much appeal it has anymore. No, in the urban, I think it is like that, but in the hinterland, even now it is the job security which the government jobs provide. And also if you are actually looking for a job which is challenging and which is not constant on a day-to-day basis, every day is a new day, no day is same, yesterday it ends at yesterday, today is a new day and it's completely challenging and with changes and the things that you do on a day-to-day basis is varied. If you are looking for something like that, then this is a very good job to be in. Variety. Variety of these things. So it's not mundane. It's not a desk job that you go to... Maybe in the corporate sector, I don't know, but you may burn out faster than one. And also the kind of opportunities you get to work in various fields, it's extremely diverse. It gives you a good platform. The fact that we are doing this with you is another aspect of this job. Hadn't we been IPS officers, we wouldn't be here. Anujit, would you like to say something about your background? Like I know you, but for the audience, like you went from engineering to corporate role to then becoming police. Yeah, so I have a basic engineering degree and I got into a VLSI job, working in Delhi for some time. What is a VLSI job? I was working for a company which basically does chip designing, VLSI design.",
