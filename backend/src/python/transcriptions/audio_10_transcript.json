  "full_text": "Hygiene needs to be taught in schools because today, like even the way you put your privacy status on whatever social media you're on, I think everybody generally makes their life you know, public, which might give an opportunity for a cyber criminal to misuse that. What are five tips, cybercrime that you can give? Not to share your personal details, not to share the OTP, not to click these unknown links and not to listen to any unsolicited advice on this thing. Don't download APK files which you don't know of. And don't translate money matters with strangers. Your bank will not call you, that's one simple thing, again a common sense thing. Because banks are, I know, I mean if you go to any bank's website or anything, the first thing in the ticker is banks do not call you for any of these things. So those small tips, if you can remember and the thing is, in case you fall prey as well, it's important to dial 1930 to report it because there's a mechanism to, at least in financial frauds, to stop the flow of money, report it immediately. 1930. There's a chance of, you know, getting back your money is more if you report quickly. Now there's a system where everything is integrated with the financial system and all that. So a complaint is raised and that flow of funds is stopped. So there's a high probability of getting back the money. Like in traffic accident, there is a concept of golden hour. So within that one hour or so, if the injured is shifted to the hospital, either his survival or the injury rate will be lesser, survival rate will be higher rather. Similarly, in cyber crimes also, the quicker you inform, the better is the chance of recovery. Anuchet, any final message to the youth who want to be policemen maybe? Yeah, I think it's a very nice, exciting career to be in. Like I said, if you are service oriented, you want to do something, bring about a change, however small or however incremental it can be. And if you look for a challenging and exciting kind of a job, which varies day to day and gives you a lot of opportunities to work in various sectors. I think this is the job to be in. So anybody interested, please, please do take up it. Take it up. Take up one of the four jobs. Solving crimes has been the, you know, kind of a passion for many of the, right from young age itself. Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, Sherlock Holmes kind of thing. Nowadays in police department, you come across several such cases wherein till the crime is solved, you feel like it's a big puzzle kind of a thing. Once it is solved, then you realise how simple it is. Unfortunately, there's not been one good series on how investigation is done. Sherlock Holmes, have you seen? I love that show. Yeah, of course. But I mean, not everything is as they make it out to be. But there are some connections that you do during any investigation. I think that's, I mean, some extraordinary cases are there. If they would, I would think they could do a good job of making that. Going to the depth of any investigation, it's really fascinating. It's very fascinating. Really, really fascinating. It'll actually be such a killer show if somebody makes it. But will you, as police, share? Because then your methods come out in the open, right? That problem is there. It is there. But I think at least the nuances of investigation or the soft skills required to do that and the methodologies employed. That's all the more reason that youngsters should join the department and know how fascinating it is. Because you do not get it in public domain. How does it feel to like hold a gun and be in uniform? Very personally, like whenever I see a policeman, I've never had a gun. So I feel like, how do I know how it feels? Like wearing that uniform, having a gun, feeling powerful, even when you're walking down a road. It must feel different. Uniform. Forget about the gun. Gun is just one aspect of it. But when you wear a uniform, your gait changes, you are more confident, your attitude, your behavior in public, this thing, and you are looked upon also by the public in that fashion. So generally, the confidence level is higher when you wear uniform compared to when you are not. That is always there. Weapon is just a part of our job. I don't think we give much importance to it. Nowadays, you hardly get a chance to use it also. At least not at our level. And there's a certain amount of pride as well. So I think that comes out. Pride is definitely there. Pride of uniform is definitely there. The other person's attitude also changes. Yeah. Everybody must see you and think something else, right? Like, it's not like seeing a normal person. It isn't. So that's the whole identifier of a khaki uniform, right? So you are identified as a police. They might not know your name or XYZ or your rank or whatever it is, but you identify as a police. So that itself is like, that's the discernible difference between wearing a plain cloth and a uniform. Forget about the IPS, even the sub-inspector, even the constable. So his social status, societal, this thing is different compared to a person who is working in other departments or in private. The last part when you guys spoke about uniform and gun, it sounded like, I feel like, wow, this must be a good feeling. I'm trying to figure out what is the trigger where a young kid goes online and says how to be a policeman. What I personally feel is that in India, it requires a social change, wherein you no longer say if you do something wrong, police will come. As a kid, if you're going to say, hey, police will come, eat here, talk here, police will come. Until you start showing it as a fearful kind of a thing, that's not going to change. It's my opinion. What should change will be the fact that it's more of the respect of the law. And you see them as enforcers of law. That needs to change. And that will happen over a period of time. We are a very nascent, we have this colonial yoke that we need to throw off. It's still not gone. So I think it will take some time. It is changing. And technology and social media is helping that way. To bring about this facet of this thing. So I hope it happens that a person Googles and he finds out, searches for something and he says, how do I become a police officer and how do I join it'll be it'll be a wonderful thing. I think that's going to increase only. But I think we need to, like you said, leverage social media now to bring about that perception change saying that this is also something worth striving for and doing. It's just that the inner workings are not known. Even to us, being a son of a police officer, I did not know how the department works minutely as I do now. What is seen is a little bit, what's apparent in the uniform or the movies that you see. I think they shape the perception. I think with. Unfortunately, they don't do a good job. They don't do a good job. They say it's extremes. But then police job is nowadays the most sought after job. I mean, if you go by the number of applications, even for a policeman's job also, lakhs and lakhs are applying. Sub-inspectors job also. Huge number. Huge number of people apply and the posts are very limited. And there are so many coaching centers which are coaching people to apply for the job and then you have the physical component also. So there they train you physically also, then how to solve the question paper. So a lot of coaching centers are thriving. They're doing a big business out of it. Done. Thank you both for doing this. And thank you for making Sunday so much more fun than my normal Sunday would have been like. Hope you guys had fun. Thank you. It has been our pleasure to interact and understand your perspective and your view of the police and all. So it was quite enjoyable. And it's nice for three Bangaloreans to catch up. Yeah. Let's promote Bangalore. Absolutely. Yeah. Even though that wasn't very certain. It was fun, right? Yeah. Yeah. Sir too, won't he? Yeah. Yeah. Very chilled out. It was a nice conversation. Yeah. It was yummy. It's again podi covered. Podi covered? Yeah.",
