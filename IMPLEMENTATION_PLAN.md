- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 for YouTube access
- **Video/Audio**: YouTube Player API
- **API Integration**: YouTube Data API v3
- **AI Integration**: Llama 4.0 API
- **PWA**: Workbox (later phases)

## Iterative Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Foundation üèóÔ∏è
**Goal**: Set up development environment and basic structure

1. **Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite**
   - Create new Vite project with React-TS template
   - Configure TypeScript strict mode
   - Set up development scripts

2. **Install and configure shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**
   - Install Tailwind CSS and configure
   - Initialize shadcn/ui CLI
   - Add basic components (Button, Input, Card)

3. **Create basic project structure and TypeScript types**
   - Set up folder structure (components, hooks, utils, types, services, api)
   - Define core TypeScript interfaces from API specification
   - Create API client service layer for backend communication
   - Create initial routing with React Router
   - Set up environment variables for API base URL and Google OAuth keys

**Deliverable**: Working development environment with styled hello world

### Phase 2: YouTube Authentication üîê
**Goal**: Implement Google OAuth and extract user interests

1. **Implement Google OAuth 2.0 login flow for YouTube access**
   - Create API client methods for auth endpoints (/auth/google/*)
   - Implement Google OAuth flow using service layer
   - Create login/logout components with shadcn/ui
   - Handle authentication state management with API tokens

2. **Extract user interests from YouTube watch history and subscriptions**
   - Implement API client for user profile endpoints (/user/*)
   - Fetch user's YouTube interests through service layer
   - Create user interest profile from YouTube data
   - Store user preferences with proper token refresh logic

**Deliverable**: Working YouTube authentication with user interest extraction

### Phase 3: Core Chat Interface üí¨
**Goal**: Build functional chat UI with user context

1. **Implement chat interface with live YouTube user context via API**
   - Create ChatContainer, MessageList, MessageInput components
   - Use shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Button, ScrollArea)
   - Implement API client for chat endpoints (/chat/*)
   - Include real user's YouTube context in API requests

2. **Test chat UI with real user data from service API**
   - Use live API calls to backend service
   - Test message rendering with actual API responses
   - Ensure responsive design on mobile with real data

**Deliverable**: Interactive chat interface with live YouTube user context

### Phase 4: AI Integration ü§ñ
**Goal**: Connect chat to Llama 4.0 with personalized context

1. **Backend service handles Llama 4.0 integration (frontend connects via API)**
   - Frontend uses existing chat API endpoints
   - Service layer handles AI integration with YouTube context
   - Frontend implements proper error handling for API responses
   - Add loading states and retry logic for API calls

2. **Connect chat interface to service API with live data**
   - Use chat API endpoints for AI-powered responses
   - Handle API response streaming if supported by service
   - Add conversation context management through API
   - Display personalized responses from service layer

**Deliverable**: Working AI chat with personalized Llama 4.0 responses using live data

---

### Phase 5: YouTube Podcast Features üéß
**Goal**: Add YouTube podcast discovery and playback

1. **Integrate real-time YouTube podcast search and recommendations via API**
   - Build SearchBar with shadcn/ui Input
   - Create PodcastCard and PodcastList components
   - Implement API client for podcast endpoints (/podcasts/*)
   - Use service API for search results and personalized recommendations

2. **Implement YouTube Player API with caption integration**
   - Create VideoPlayer component with YouTube Player API
   - Implement playback API endpoints (/playback/*)
   - Add caption display and navigation features
   - Sync playback state between Player API and service API

**Deliverable**: Live YouTube podcast catalog with real-time search and streaming

---

### Phase 6: Polish & PWA üöÄ
**Goal**: Production-ready application

1. **Add PWA configuration**
   - Configure service worker with Workbox
   - Add app manifest for mobile installation
   - Implement offline functionality for basic features

2. **Mobile optimization**
   - Enhance responsive design
   - Add touch gestures for audio player
   - Optimize for mobile performance

**Deliverable**: Production-ready PWA with offline support

## Development Notes

### After Each Phase
- Test all functionality on desktop and mobile
- Update TypeScript types as needed
- Refactor components for reusability
- Update this plan with learnings

### Key Considerations
- Start with simple implementations, iterate to add complexity
- Test UI components with real data from service API
- Keep all external API calls abstracted in backend service layer
- Frontend communicates only with internal service API
- Maintain responsive design throughout development
- Handle API errors gracefully with proper user feedback
- Implement proper token refresh logic through service API
- Never use placeholder or mock data - always integrate with live service API
- Handle YouTube API quota limits gracefully
- Implement caption-based search and navigation features

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Voice commands integration
- Segment-based playback with timestamps
- Real-time Q&A during podcast playback
- Topic extraction and categorization per episode
- User preference learning algorithms
- Social features (sharing, playlists)
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
