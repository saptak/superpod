## Development Notes

### After Each Phase
- Test all functionality on desktop and mobile
- Update TypeScript types as needed
- Refactor components for reusability
- Update this plan with learnings

### Key Considerations
- Start with simple implementations, iterate to add complexity
- Test UI components with real data from the beginning
- Keep API calls abstracted in service layer (Spotify + Llama 4.0)
- Maintain responsive design throughout development
- Handle Spotify Premium account requirements gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for OAuth flows
- Store Spotify tokens securely with refresh logic
- Never use placeholder or mock data - always integrate with live APIs

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Voice commands integration
- Segment-based playback with timestamps
- User preference learning
- Social features (sharing, playlists)
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
