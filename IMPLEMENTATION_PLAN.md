- **AI Integration**: Llama 4.0 API
- **PWA**: Workbox (later phases)

## Iterative Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Foundation üèóÔ∏è
**Goal**: Set up development environment and basic structure

1. **Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite**
   - Create new Vite project with React-TS template
   - Configure TypeScript strict mode
   - Set up development scripts

2. **Install and configure shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**
   - Install Tailwind CSS and configure
   - Initialize shadcn/ui CLI
   - Add basic components (Button, Input, Card)

3. **Create basic project structure and TypeScript types**
   - Set up folder structure (components, hooks, utils, types, services)
   - Define core TypeScript interfaces (User, SpotifyProfile, Podcast, Episode, Message)
   - Create initial routing with React Router
   - Set up environment variables for Spotify API keys

**Deliverable**: Working development environment with styled hello world

### Phase 3: Core Chat Interface üí¨
**Goal**: Build functional chat UI with user context

1. **Implement chat interface with user context**
   - Create ChatContainer, MessageList, MessageInput components
   - Use shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Button, ScrollArea)
   - Include user's Spotify interests in chat context
   - Implement message state management with useState

2. **Test chat UI with mock data**
   - Add sample conversations with personalized context
   - Test message rendering and scrolling
   - Ensure responsive design on mobile

**Deliverable**: Interactive chat interface with user interest context

### Phase 4: AI Integration ü§ñ
**Goal**: Connect chat to Llama 4.0 with personalized context

1. **Set up Llama 4.0 API integration with Spotify context**
   - Configure API client with proper authentication
   - Create API service layer with error handling
   - Include user's Spotify interests in AI prompts
   - Add loading states and retry logic

2. **Connect chat interface to Llama 4.0**
   - Replace mock data with real AI responses
   - Handle streaming responses if supported
   - Add conversation context management
   - Personalize responses based on user's music taste

**Deliverable**: Working AI chat with personalized Llama 4.0 responses

   - Configure service worker with Workbox
   - Add app manifest for mobile installation
   - Implement offline functionality for basic features

2. **Mobile optimization**
   - Enhance responsive design
   - Add touch gestures for audio player
   - Optimize for mobile performance

**Deliverable**: Production-ready PWA with offline support

## Development Notes

### After Each Phase
- Test all functionality on desktop and mobile
- Update TypeScript types as needed
- Refactor components for reusability
- Update this plan with learnings

### Key Considerations
- Start with simple implementations, iterate to add complexity
- Test UI components in isolation before integration
- Keep API calls abstracted in service layer (Spotify + Llama 4.0)
- Maintain responsive design throughout development
- Handle Spotify Premium account requirements gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for OAuth flows
- Store Spotify tokens securely with refresh logic

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Voice commands integration
- Segment-based playback with timestamps
- User preference learning
- Social features (sharing, playlists)
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
