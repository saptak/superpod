  "topics_analysis": "They talked about the police department, specifically the Indian Police Service (IPS) and how it works. They covered the different levels of entry into the police force, like Constabulary, Sub-Inspector, Assistant SP, and Superintendent of Police. They also discussed how IPS officers are allocated to different states and can go on deputation to central organizations. The conversation also touched on the challenges of being a police officer, traffic violations and fines, and even briefly mentioned self-driving cars and a new electric vehicle concept. Oh, and they also seemed to be promoting a positive view of Bangalore and the police force to encourage young people to join.",
  "comprehensive_summary": "## WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?\nThis podcast episode is all about demystifying the police force in India, specifically in Karnataka. The conversation is super casual and informative, covering everything from the different ranks in the police department to common misconceptions about policing. The host's goal is to encourage young people to consider a career in the police force and to change the narrative around Bangalore.\n\n## KEY TOPICS COVERED\n• The different entry levels into the police force, including IPS, Assistant SP, Sub-Inspector, and Constabulary\n• The cadre allocation system and how IPS officers are assigned to states\n• The role of technology in policing and the potential for self-driving vehicles\n\n## COOL INSIGHTS\nThe episode reveals some pretty interesting facts - did you know that only about 5% of police officers in Karnataka are IPS officers, while the majority (around 83%) are Constabulary? The host also shares that the fine collected from traffic violations is more for deterrent effect than revenue generation, and that it's not a significant contributor to the government's revenue.\n\n## WHO SHOULD LISTEN?\nAnyone curious about the police force, law enforcement, or considering a career in public service would love this episode. It's also a great listen for anyone interested in Bangalore or Karnataka, as it offers a local perspective on policing and community.",

  "full_transcript": "become what? D.Y.S.P. Right. And with IPS you become? Assistant SP. But in four years you become SP, Superintendent of Police. The third level of entry is the Sub-Inspector. So you can join at the Sub-Inspector level. That examination is again conducted by the recruitment wing of the Police Department. And the lowest level is the Constabulary. You join at the Constabulary level. Again the exam is conducted at the district level or the unit level what we call. They constitute a majority of the police force, about 83%. And the IPS officers would be like under 5%? So our cadre strength in Karnataka is about 220. That's it? Yes. That many, that's the max cadre strength. So each state has a fixed cadre strength of how many IPS officers it can be. Would you like some coffee? Black coffee? No, sir. I am good. Would you like to have? Then I will try. Which one? Espresso or black coffee? Black coffee. Basic fundamental, actual people who actually do a majority of the work is at the Constabulary and the Head Constabulary. And the officers are senior levels. The basic fundamental unit of policing is the Police Station. So the number of IPS officers is fixed for each state. It's about 200-250. Yeah. Like UP would have more obviously because it's a bigger state as compared to Karnataka. You can go on deputation to central organizations like you can join the CBI, there are parliamentary organizations like CISF, PSF like that. You can go. PD and all that. Yeah. They are all deputation posts. You can go to a state but with the concurrence of that concerned state as well as the approval of the central government. But since UPSC IPS is a national exam, once you clear, do you pick Karnataka or is it assigned to you? There is basically a cadre allocation system which is in place. So you give a choice. So it has been divided into multiple zones. In each zone, there is a particular state. Right. So it's your choice of zone and the state. Right. Depending on your rank. Right. The better your rank, the better your chance of getting what you want. Right. Yeah. So it's not a given that you will get this particular thing. Of course, if your ranking is good, then you will get probably the cadre of your choice. So each, the entire, this thing has been divided into cadres. So Karnataka, generally along the state lines, but there are cadres which are joint cadres as well. Right. And then there is the Uttarakhand cadre, which is basically all the union territories and like that. Right. And is there a preference, like most people want to be in a certain area? Not really. I don't think so. No? Generally, it has been like, it's also perception kind of a thing where you feel like, okay, there, you don't work there. So generally what happens is people would like to choose their home cadre because of naturally the affiliation towards your home state. But otherwise, you would like to have somebody work in a place which is next to your state. Right. But there are people who would like to work in some areas which are generally... Right. You have dogs? Yeah, I used to. We used to have a lab. Yeah? I didn't expect him to have a Shih Tzu. It doesn't go with the bike. You're not having?  Our podcast is like a charity thing. There's no advertising, there's no sponsorship, nobody pays for anything. In this episode today, my agenda is get young people A, to like police guys, B, I'm from Bangalore, I hate all the hate that is coming for Bangalore. So I want Bangalore to look nice somehow. And C is we should get more people to want to be policemen. I think the criticism is totally unwarranted. It's a bit much. It's just like... I think this move to try to... You have to live with the criticism what police gets. Because ultimately in police, either you have to be with the victim or with the accused. If you help the victim, the accused will blame you. If you help the accused, the victim will blame you. So better to help the victim and let the accused, let them say what they want. I think the one reason why it becomes so much in the news is in Bombay or Delhi, for example, the airport is close by. Here the airport is 40-50 kilometers away. So whenever anyone lands, their first experience is a 50 kilometer drive in the city. Especially the air ball fly over. In Bombay, it's half the distance or one third the distance. And you have no role in that one. Nothing. What we can do in that? Absolutely nothing. We invested in a new company recently. I did and Axel did. Oh, that A-taxi? Yeah. Very interesting concept. Yeah, good concept. So it's an electric vehicle. It takes off from almost anywhere. Right now they're thinking on top of the hotels in Bangalore. It has a range of about 160 kilometers. Six passengers can sit at one time. And the failure points, because helicopters are very risky because there's one rotor and one wing kind of a thing. This has six or eight of them. And the cost per machine is something like seven, eight crores. If they are thinking at a certain price point above Uber, maybe 3x, 4x, 5x, they'll be able to make up for that cost very fast. It's very interesting. Maybe that's the answer. Could be. Yeah. Do you think that's coming? Self-driving vehicles? I know you're really into technology and all of that. It's not the question of technology. It's the question of need, societal need. Do you actually require a self-driving car here is the question at that price. So if you see U.S., they have the dearth of drivers, especially for long haul trailers like this Lumbering and all that, which they're not getting. So there a level five or level four makes sense. But here there isn't any. Finally, at the end of the day, societal need will dictate is what I feel. It's not a question of technology at all. But maybe the need for the number of cars goes down. Because if you have a self-driving car which is being shared, then you don't have to have your own car. Could be. And the other aspect would be you're stuck in traffic. So you make something productive. You can use your time productively. That could be the other way of thinking. Should we go to the next place? Yeah, we should. Yeah, we'll try. You're comfortable. Don't fall off. You'll tell me the way, na? Yeah, yeah. So Anushit, what happens if I make a traffic violation with you in the car? With me? Yeah. That'll be terrible. You need not do anything. You'll be captured in some camera and then the chalan will come to your house. So you'll be made to pay up. Have those prices gone up to break a traffic light and all that? It was the same thing which happened in 2019. But each state has modified accordingly to the needs of the state. So no changes in Attish in Karnataka. It must add up to a lot, right? All these fines in terms of tax collection? Not much. Not very significant. 150-170 crores. Contrary to popular perception, it's not a revenue earning department. The government doesn't expect revenue to be generated out of police department. Yeah. The fine what we collect is more for deterrent effect. Basically, it should pinch the person so that he is discouraged from violating the traffic rules. So sir, 20 years ago, I used to work in a call center called 24 bar 7. So funnily enough, this used to be my office. Oh. Embassy icon. The building looks exactly the same. So I've seen this road from then. Okay."
